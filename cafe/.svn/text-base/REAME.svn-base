This is a partial port of the D0 cafe package under RootCore and
xAODRoootAccess.


cafe is an analysis framework developped in the D0 collaboration: 

http://cdcvs0.fnal.gov/cgi-bin/public-cvs/cvsweb-public.cgi/cafe/?cvsroot=d0cvs

with Reiner Hauser as the initial author and contributions from Herb Greenlee, 
Slava Shary and Gordon Watts for the core functionalities re-used here.
